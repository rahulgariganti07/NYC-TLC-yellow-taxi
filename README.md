Data Dictionary

#Task
The Big Data tools used - Hadoop Framework, Apache HBase and Apache Sqoop. Used an AWS EMR instance of m4.xlarge cluster 64 GB with all the services and install additional services as needed (AWS RDS MySQL etc).
# Data Ingestion Tasks:
Task 1. Create an RDS instance in your AWS account and upload the data from two files (yellow_tripdata_2017-01.csv & yellow_tripdata_2017-02.csv) from the dataset. Make sure to create an appropriate schema for the data sets before uploading them to RDS.

Task 2. Use Sqoop command to ingest the data from RDS into the HBase Table.

Task 3. Bulk import data from next two files in the dataset on your EMR cluster to your HBase Table using the relevant codes. Note: For the above task 3, you just need to import data from the subsequent 2 csv files
# MapReduce Tasks:
Task 4. Write MapReduce codes to perform the tasks using the files youâ€™ve downloaded on your EMR Instance:

Which vendors have the most trips, and what is the total revenue generated by that vendor?
Which pickup location generates the most revenue?
What are the different payment types used by customers and their count? The final results should be in a sorted format.
What is the average trip time for different pickup locations?
Calculate the average tips to revenue ratio of the drivers for different pickup locations in sorted format.
How does revenue vary over time? Calculate the average trip revenue per month - analysing it by hour of the day (day vs night) and the day of the week (weekday vs weekend). NOTE: It's recommended to use MRJob for completing the MapReduce taks above.
